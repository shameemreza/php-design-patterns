##Design Patterns using PHP

There are numerous ways to structure the code and project for your web application, and you can put as much or as little thought as you like into architecting. But it is usually a good idea to follow common patterns because it will make your code easier to manage and easier for others to understand.

###Singleton

When designing web applications, it often makes sense conceptually and architecturally to allow access to one and only one instance of a particular class. The singleton pattern enables us to do this.


###Strategy

With the strategy pattern you encapsulate specific families of algorithms allowing the client class responsible for instantiating a particular algorithm to have no knowledge of the actual implementation.
